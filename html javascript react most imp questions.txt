********************HTML CSS*****************
HTML VS HTML5
HTML5 is the fifth version of HTML. Many elements are removed or modified from HTML5.
Browser support: HTML5 has browser support. It means even if some browsers are not supporting HTML5 you will be able to load a webpage on that browser.
Geolocation: HTML5 provides a geolocation feature. With the help of the geolocation feature, we can insert or implement maps on our web pages for example world maps, etc.
HTML5 supports both audio and video while none of them were part of
HTML cannot allow JavaScript to run within the web browser, while HTML5 provides full support for running JavaScript.
In HTML5, inline mathML and SVG can be used in a text, while in HTML it is not possible.
HTML5 supports new types of form controls, such as date and time, email, number, category, title, Url, search, etc.
Many elements have been introduced in HTML5. Some of the most important are time, audio, description, embed, fig, shape, footer, article, canvas, navy, output, section, source, track, video, etc.

What are Semantic Elements?
A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.
Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.
Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.

Difference btw Position relative and absolute.

Relative Position: Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of an element with position: 
relative; property will cause it to adjust from its normal position. 
The other objects or elements will not fill the gap.

Absolute Position: An element with position: absolute; will cause it to adjust its position with respect to its parent.
 If no parent is present, then it uses the document body as parent.

WHAT IS FLEX BOX ?
basically flexbox is a display property it help us to design the layout of website very easily.
 without having to write so many positioning properties. in flex we use so many properties like flex direction justifycontent alighn item
so it help us to make layout of website.

What is BOX MODAL IN CSS ?
Every element is surronding by invisible box. it has four layers content,padding,border,margin
content in it actual content.
padding is area btw content and border.
margin  is the space btw the elements.



**************JAVASCRIPT QUESTIONS***********
WHAT IS EVENT LOOP ?
 it a runtime modal which is present in the javascriptengine .event loop is similar to Asynchrounous await concept . event loop mai 2 cheezein main hoti hia call stack and queue stack .
jb b koi aisa function call ho jis mai settimeout laga ho to sary kaam ek hongy lekin setime out wala jesy aye ga wp callstack mai apend hojayega
lekin jb is mai time lagy ga to us ko webapi browser mai bej daiga or baki k kaam ho rhy hongy jb is ka time hojayega to is ko dubar queue stack
mia push kr daingy us k bs ya daiky ga k call stack khali hogaya to setimeout waly kaam ko call stack mai push kr k kaam khatam hojayega.
 
WHAT IS DOM ?
dom stand for document object modal w. when browser or client send information to the server,then server send different type of data like
html xml any kind of data when browser get that data then it convert into javascript object. it parse the html into javascript obj and
store into memory. it structure is like a tree of nodes every node denote the html element.

WHAT IS HOISTING ?
we can access any varible and function before we have initialize them .it related to the memory allocation phase of the execution context.

WHAT IS CLOSURES.
it is a function  reference to its lexical env forexample ineer function k access to the parameter that declared in the outer func.

what is callback hell?
when one function has nested callback and .where every callback stating an argument which is the result of prev callback. to avoid callback hell
problem theis is a promises in javascript. 

HOW MANY PARAMETERS ARE PROMISES HAVE.
it has 2 parameters resolve and reject.

WHAT IS MAP FILTER AND REDUCE ?
they are high order functions in javascript beacuse it takes another function as args
The map() method is used for creating a new array from an existing one, applying a function to each one of the elements of the first array.
filter the element of array that condi we provide inside it. it return same arrray . it length must be less then or equal to the input array.
REDUCE it takes all the element of the array and mix it into a single final value. it takes 2 parameter that is the acumilatorand the current value.

HOW MANY SCOPES ARE THERE IN JAVASCRIPT ? 
Global scope local scope functional scope block scope .


there are 3 types of scope in javascript 
global scope 
function scope
blocking scope

what is call apply bind ?
it help us to borrowing function . so we can bore function from an object.
Apply is very similar to the call function. The only difference is that in apply you can pass an array as an argument list.

WHAT IS THIS KEY WORD IN JAVASCRIPT ?
In JavaScript, the this keyword refers to an object.
Which object depends on how this is being invoked (used or called).
The this keyword refers to different objects depending on how it is used:

In an object method, this refers to the object.
Alone, this refers to the global object.
In a function, this refers to the global object.
In a function, in strict mode, this is undefined.

DIFERENCE BTW ARROW FUNCTION AND REGULAR FUNCTION
arrow function is short code,arrow function have no argument binding, it canonot access arguments.
it will show reference error. arrow function is not constructable. duplicate argu are not allow it show error.
it has no own this.there will be no biniding for this function.


WHAT IS MEMOIZATION ?
memoization is like a catche it is use for perfomance optimization , we are storing a cast value like if you are
 using a function then we are storing it returns value as a cashe ,
 it is use to avoid re rendering problems in react. har bar function pai heavy calculations na ho
. react mai ya usememo or use callback hooks in react .

WHAT IS REST AND SPREAD OPERATORS?
both are denoted by 3 dots like (...others) rest operator collector multiply element and it will condence it into the form of a new array element
Spread operator it allow expresion to be expendible where multiply element and arg or expresions are expected.


*************REACT *************

WHAT IS VIRTUAL DOM ?
Virtual dom is a copy of dom . it is a virtual representation . when ever app is render first time
 tree of react element is created and it is put into the memory and it is syn with the real dom
when any prop or state change happen or like any update addition happen  then a second copy of virtual 
dom is created then both of them compared with each other through algorithem call difficult alg
and only the updated value send to the first copy of dom . so the first copy sync with the real dom
only the real value send to the dom reconcilition.basically it improve the perfomnce of our application
thats why react use virtual dom concept.

what is advantages of react js ?
first is virtual dom so the rendering of app is very fast.
we use jsx in react so it help us to write react app very easiy ut help us to write html and js 
together .
one way data binding like parent to child data pass .
we can make single page app in react js 

what is context and redux ? 

we use context hook which help us to declare the state globally if we talk about and if their is large 
application then we use redux where we can just store all our global data in centralized store
where every component can get data from .


HOW REDUX WORKS ? 
there is 3 core concept of redux action reducer and store .
in store where all our application data is stored in the form of objective tree .
action is like a clean javascript object that must have type attribute and the reducer is a 
function that take two arg that is the state  and action based on what action we are dispatching
like what action we want perform on our state then reducer will perform that action and it will
return the new state thats howi redux work.

WHAT IS HIGHER ORDER COMPONENTS ? 
high order components wo comp jo dosry comp ko as a prop laita hai or ek alag sy comp
return krta ho .
WHAT IS LIFE CYCLE METHOD IN REACT JS ?
there are 3 phases in react life cycle.
mounting
updateing
unmounting

COMPONENTDIDMOUNT
jb b koi component first time render ya load hoga ya chaly ga .
Constructor b ek life cycle hai agr ap chaty ho k page load hony sy phely b kuch initialize ho
to hum is k ander liky gy.
Render b apny andr ek life cycle hai
JSX is use for to write html in javascript. browser jsx nhe samjhta is liye humary pas transpiler ka
concept hota ha.jis sy jsx convert hojata hai jis ko browseer samjhta hai.
COMPONENTDIDUPDATE jb b koi cheez update hogi like state to ya chaly ga.
COMPONENTWILLUNMOUNT jb b hum koi component ko remove kary gy to ya chaly ga.
